The 3 additional features which I have added to my budget app are:
1. A slider delete button which can be used to delete entries and is reflected by a Scaffold Messenger.
2. An icon in the Expenses page, which redirects to a page with a graph of Expense vs Category. It can help track the amount of expenses incurred upon the revenue.
3. An icon in the Expenses page which can help sort the list of entries by its price.
